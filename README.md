### About Me
Hello! I'm a Software Engineer with a Bachelor's in Informatics Engineering and Computing, which I finished with a GPA of 16/20, currently seeking my Master's in the same field.<br>
I love developing projects which bridge personal interests, creativity, and logic - especially videogames which explore interactive storytelling and immersive worldbuilding!

I am from SÃ£o Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal - although I spend most of my time in Porto, Portugal, due to my studies!

In my free time, you'll often find me playing games, running Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, crafting new fantasy worlds, or diving into fresh ideas and concepts.

Feel free to reach out! <br>

### Personal Projects
Here are some of my personal projects, most of these are passion projects which focus on my interests heavily - ranging from DnD to neural networks.

| Name | Description |
|-----|------|
| CNN from Scratch | I want to attempt to develop a CNN from scratch, as the concept seems simple enough to implement yourself. |
| [The Blundering Barrel Extended Universe](https://github.com/antoniocrego/bbeuwiki) | I host a Wiki with information regarding the world in which my DnD campaigns take place! |
